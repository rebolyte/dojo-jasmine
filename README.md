# Unit testing with Dojo and Jasmine

Run `tests/specRunner.html` to run the tests.

To add new tests, add your `*.specs.js` file to the spec folder, and add it to the dependencies in the `require` call in specRunner.html

Thanks to [this repo](https://github.com/gsans/jasmine-require-bootstrap) and [this tutorial](http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2393-writing-my-first-unit-tests-with-jasmine-and-requirejs.htm) for how to get started.
